📁Part A — Theory (Short Questions)


Q:Why is using AI Development Agents (like Gemini CLI) for repetitive setup tasks better for your growth as a system architect?

A: Because you spend hours and hours in doing repetitive tasks. Here comes AI Development agents like gemini CLI so you only pay attention on designing systems ,thinking about architecture, or solving bigger problems.

Meanwhile AI does project setup, file scaffolding, environment creation, testing stubs, deployments.


Q:Explain how the Nine Pillars of AIDD help a developer grow into an M-Shaped
Developer.

A:The nine pillars are not individuals skills but ther are system that effects the every aspect of software development like:

1.system design

2.system building

3.system testing

4.system automation

5.system deployment

6.system maintenance

7.AI integration across the entire stack

That’s what an M-shaped developer is:
A multi-skilled professional with deep spikes in various fields (AI agents, cloud, automation, testing, dev environments, architecture) and the skill of tying them together into one coherent workflow.

Q:Why does Vibe Coding usually create problems after one week?

A:Vibe coding works in moment but after week everything breaks down when :

requirements change

the project grows

different features interact

Q:How would Specification-Driven Development prevent those problems?

A: Specification-Driven Development prevents those problems by 

write what you want

define the architecture

define behavior

define interfaces

define data flow

-----------------------------------**-------------------------------------------------------------

Q:How does architecture-first thinking change the role of a developer in AIDD?

A: In traditional software development , developer mostly writes code but in AIDD developer design architecture , describing behavior , thinking in flows, not files

Q:Explain why developers must think in layers and systems instead of raw code.

A:When you think in systems:

AI can reason better , you avoid chaos as app grows ,new features don’t break old ones

📁 Part B — Practical Task (Screenshot Required)

Prompt : You are expert email writer so write a one paragraph specification for an email validation function.requirements are must contain @ , and valid domain , should give message with clear error dont write code or make file

1-paragraph specification:

Email validation is a critical step in ensuring data integrity and user communication. A robust validation process verifies that an email address adheres to fundamental structural rules, primarily requiring the presence of a single "@" symbol to separate the local part from the domain, and a domain that includes at least one dot (e.g., example.com) to signify a top-level domain. If an email fails to meet these criteria—for instance, lacking an "@" symbol, containing multiple "@" symbols, having an empty local or domain part, or featuring an improperly formatted domain—the system should return a clear, specific error message guiding the user to correct the input. This proactive feedback prevents miscommunications, reduces bounce rates, and enhances the overall user experience by ensuring that only deliverable email addresses are accepted.
