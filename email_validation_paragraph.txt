Email validation is a critical step in ensuring data integrity and user communication. A robust validation process verifies that an email address adheres to fundamental structural rules, primarily requiring the presence of a single "@" symbol to separate the local part from the domain, and a domain that includes at least one dot (e.g., example.com) to signify a top-level domain. If an email fails to meet these criteria—for instance, lacking an "@" symbol, containing multiple "@" symbols, having an empty local or domain part, or featuring an improperly formatted domain—the system should return a clear, specific error message guiding the user to correct the input. This proactive feedback prevents miscommunications, reduces bounce rates, and enhances the overall user experience by ensuring that only deliverable email addresses are accepted.
